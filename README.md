# Kuba Hit Game

This is a fun clicker game built with React and TypeScript.

This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To run the game on your local machine for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the game:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be placed in the `dist/` directory. The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run this command and deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder automatically.
